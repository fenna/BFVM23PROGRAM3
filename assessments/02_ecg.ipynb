    "# Time series: ECG study case \n",
    "\n",
    "author: F. Feenstra, B. Barnard\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the next two weeks, we will study time series using ECG data. Throughout this period, you will acquire a deeper understanding of extracting features from ECG data and you will learn how to do analyses on streaming data. Embracing the principle of rapid prototyping, our focus will be on developing a functional solution, allowing us to iterate and evolve our approach over the course of these two weeks. \n"

    "## About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will work with is ECG data. ECG stands for Electrocardiogram: a medical test that measures the electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. The ECG records the electrical signals that trigger each heartbeat and displays them as a graph or series of waves. The data is offered by a simulator producing electrocardiogram waves that you need to access via a web socket.\n",

    "## Features of ECG\n",
    "\n",
    "PQRST refers to the different waves and intervals observed in an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which is a graphical representation of the electrical activity of the heart over time. Each letter in **PQRST** corresponds to a specific phase or component of the ECG waveform:\n",
    "\n",
    "**P Wave:** The P wave represents atrial depolarization, which is the electrical activity that causes the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) to contract and pump blood into the ventricles. The P wave is the first deflection seen on the ECG and is typically small.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QRS Complex:** The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization, which is the electrical activity associated with the contraction of the ventricles (the lower chambers of the heart). The QRS complex is usually a larger and more prominent waveform on the ECG.\n",
    "\n",
    "**T Wave:** The T wave represents ventricular repolarization, which is the recovery phase of the ventricles as they prepare for the next contraction. The T wave follows the QRS complex and is generally a smaller waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also the [Cardiac Conduction System and Understanding ECG Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYZ4daFwMa8).\n",
    "\n",
    "The PQRST sequence provides important information about the timing and coordination of the heart's electrical activity. Abnormalities in the shape, duration, or timing of these waves and complexes can indicate various cardiac conditions, such as arrhythmias, ischemia, or other heart-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to PQRST, there are other components and intervals in an ECG, such as the PR interval (measuring the time from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) and the QT interval (measuring the time from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave). These components collectively provide a detailed picture of the heart's electrical behavior and aid in the diagnosis of various cardiac conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch [the animation about Cardiac Arrhythmias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LrptveKYus).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multivariate: 12-lead ECG\n",
    "\n",
    "A 12-lead ECG paints a complete picture of the heart’s electrical activity by recording information through 12 different perspectives with electrodes attached to the body. These 12 views are collected by placing electrodes or small, sticky patches on the chest (precordial), wrists, and ankles. These electrodes are connected to a machine that registers the heart’s electrical activity.\n",
