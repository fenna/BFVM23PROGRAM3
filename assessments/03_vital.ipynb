    "# Assignment: Data Analysis of Vital Signs in Surgical Patients using VitalDB\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain Relevance\n",
    "Monitoring vital signs is crucial in evaluating a patient's physiological state during surgical interventions. VitalDB, an extensive repository, offers access to detailed vital sign data recorded from surgical patients. This assignment aims to harness previously acquired skills by developing a client application for processing and analyzing vital signs data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "The VitalDB (Vital Signs DataBase) is an open dataset created specifically to facilitate machine learning studies related to monitoring vital signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is stored in the public cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed and analysed using application programming interfaces and Python library[1,2,3]. Documentation about the vitalDB can be found here: https://physionet.org/content/vitaldb/1.0.0/vital_files/#files-panel\n",

    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You get proficiency in interpreting instructions and documentation to access data from non-standard sources, such as VitalDB.\n",
    "2.\tYou demonstrate a high level of competence in applying python and relevant libraries as well as appropriate mathematical, and statistical methods to effectively identify patterns, causal relationships, and actionable insights.\n",
    "3.\tYou adeptly select appropriate data analysis methods, provide sound justifications for your choice, or creatively adapt existing methods to develop solutions for the problems. \n",
    "4.\tYou can integrate diverse knowledge domains, effectively handle complexity, and extract meaningful information from data, even in the presence of incomplete or challenging datasets. \n",
    "5.\tYou develop a maintainable well-structured solution comprising modules for parsing, feature extraction, analysis, and visualization of signal data. You adhere to [the fair principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data). Your code is organized, well written, well documented, traceable via version control management systems, and suitably licensed. \n",
