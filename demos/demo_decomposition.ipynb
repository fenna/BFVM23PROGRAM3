    "Time series data can exhibit a variety of patterns, and it is often helpful to split a time series into several components, each representing an underlying pattern category [1] .This is called decomposition. Time series can be decomposed in three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend ($T_{t}$):** represents the trend component, which captures the long-term movement or overall direction of the time series\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Seasonal ($S_{t}$):** Seasonality describes recurring patterns that take place within specific time intervals. For example, patterns may happen daily, weekly, monthly, or bi-annually. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Residu ($R_{t}$):** Random variations in the time series that cannot be explained by trend, or seasonality. Sometimes this is called **noise**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `statsmodels.tsa.seasonal_decompose()` function in the statsmodels library is typically used for time series decomposition, which involves breaking down a time series into its individual components, such as trend, seasonality, and residuals\n",
